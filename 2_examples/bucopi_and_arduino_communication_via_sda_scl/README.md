# Project 2: Robotics Application

## How to Use

Follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the BUCO PI circuit board and joystick connected to your Arduino.
   - Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure.

2. **Download the Code**:
   - Download the bucopi_and_arduino_communication_via_sda_scl code from the [repository](https://github.com/MJBeltran13/BUCO_PI/tree/main/2_examples/bucopi_bme280_and_blinking_led).
   - Download code for bucopi_master
   - Download code for arduino_slave

3. **Open in Arduino IDE**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.

4. **Load the Code**:
   - Open the downloaded code for the bucopi_master.
   - And open the downloaded code for the arduino_slave.

6. **Upload the Code**:
   - Select your board and port in the Arduino IDE for the bucopi_master.
   - Click the upload button to load the code onto your BUCO PI board.
   - Select your board and port in the Arduino IDE for the arduino_slave.
   - Click the upload button to load the code onto your arduino board.

8. **Interact with the joystick**:
   - modify the codes to perform the specified commands or triggers to control your robots.
   - Observe the application's responses in the serial monitor.
